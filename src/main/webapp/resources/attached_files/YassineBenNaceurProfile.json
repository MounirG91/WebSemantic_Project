      "description": "The idea of the project was a result of a brainstorming in an international Event : RoboSense (http://www.robosense.org). I was among the 101 participants (Tunisia, Italy, Portugal, Czech Republic, France, Sweden). The main subjects of the brainstorming was about creating a prototype of a platform capable of controlling the house via Internet from all over the world.The platform contains mainly 3 projects :1- The UI on a Samsung Galaxy Tab : the application offers a Super High UI allowing the users to Turn On/Off the light, Open or Close the door. Activate or Deactivate the Alarm System and finally check the Temperature of the house. It allow also a hole administration of the users : Add, Delete, Grant Control Actions.2- The Server Side : a Web Server managing all the data. We used a Data Base in order to make it easier to store, edit, delete or fetch all the data about the house.3- The hardware side : in this project we built an electronic system based on an open source electronic Italian platform named ARDUINO. Also, we built a special communication system based on an ANDROID mobile phone. this phone is used as a router (Google Cloud Messaging based GateWay)",

      "description": "The idea came from Google Agenda but with much more simpler way to use. You can sign up, sign in then create, view or manage your to do list. We added some specific description for the event (We added types such as : exams, presentation, coffee break, dinner, cinema ... ). The application works only on Android Mobile Platforms with a charming orange design. More over, we thought of using the Cloud Technology offered by Google Company the GAE (Google App Engine Cloud Service). It was a challenging choice, the aim of it was to give for the end user the possibility to sign in from any android device and fetch his events as fast as it could get to the new device. Another important option we had developed was the notification service. Before 24 hours of each planned event your mobile phone will vibrate or ring showing you a notification at the status bar of your device.",
